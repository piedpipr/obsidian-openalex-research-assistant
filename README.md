2. Press **Ctrl/Cmd + P** to open the command palette
3. Type "Process current file with OpenAlex"
4. Press Enter

**Option B: Auto-Processing**
1. In settings, enable **Auto-process new files**
2. Any new papers in your Zotero folder will be automatically processed


### Step 5: Explore Your Research Network

After processing, you'll see:
- **Enhanced paper notes** with metadata, concepts, and abstracts
- **Research hub files** in your Research-Hubs folder
- **Citation connections** linking related papers

## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Research Hubs

Research hubs are the heart of your citation network. Each hub represents a paper and shows:

- **Parent Paper**: The paper in your vault that this hub represents
- **Connected Papers**: Other papers in your vault that reference this work
- **Cited**: Papers that this work references
- **Cited By**: Papers that cite this work

### Enhanced Paper Metadata

Your Zotero paper notes get automatically enhanced with:
- Publication details (journal, year, DOI)
- Research concepts and their relevance scores
- Citation counts
- OpenAlex abstract (if available)
- Direct links to related papers


### Graph View Visualization

Use Obsidian's Graph View to see your research network:
- **Blue nodes**: Your papers
- **Orange nodes**: Research hubs
- **Red nodes**: Referenced papers not in your vault (phantom links)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No OpenAlex data found"**

- Some papers may not be in the OpenAlex database

**"Processing takes too long"**
- Reduce the number of references/citations to process
- Increase the delay between requests
- Process papers individually instead of in batches

**"Hubs not created"**
- Ensure "Create research hubs" is enabled
- Check that your hub folder path is correct
- Verify folder permissions in your vault

### Getting Help
- Check the plugin console for error messages
- Verify your internet connection for API access
- Ensure paper notes have proper formatting
